# nums_to_words

DESCRIPTION
------------
This file implements a simple algorithm that translates numbers to words. It's made for fun use primarily. However, it clearly shows how Python makes it simple to implement most algorithms, formulas, or research findings due to its explicitness, simplicity, and readability.

OOP in this file is also made simple to show how powerful Python programming language is. In this file customization by inheritance is used as seen by the classes Num and CustomNum. Python has a lot more to offer!
